# Food Delivery Web App (MERN Stack)

## Overview

A full-stack food delivery platform built with **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.
Users can browse menus, add items to the cart, place orders, and manage authentication.
State management is handled using **Redux** with persisted storage for a seamless user experience.

This is a **customized version** with my own UI and feature enhancements on top of the base MERN structure.
